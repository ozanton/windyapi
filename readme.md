# Project overview 
Receiving forecast weather data from the windy.com API every three hours by geographic coordinates for a list of cities from a .yaml file and/or the corresponding database dictionary. We get city coordinates from the openstreetmap.org service. The resulting forecast data is stored in the posrgresql database for further processing.
